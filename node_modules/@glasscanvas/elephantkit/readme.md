## Goals

### Reusability

Components are atomic and describe their own style and behaviour.

### Portability

Components are encapsulated and framework agnostic ensuring consistency across a wide array of use cases

### Fidelity

Components adhere to and are tied to the Elephant Design System design cycle.

### Scalability

ElephantKit components are abstracted away at appropriate levels to allow implementation details like design
